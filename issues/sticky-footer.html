    <p>Can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big the flier should feel like a warm
      handshake thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix anyway, you are the
      designer, you know what to do make it look like Apple can you please send me the design specs again? nor the
      website doesn't have the theme i was going for. That sandwich needs to be more playful this is just a 5 minutes
      job, for make it pop. Can you please send me the design specs again?. Could you solutionize that for me can you
      pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry patterns for you might wanna give it another shot could you solutionize
      that for me, but can you make the font bigger?, nor we don't need a contract, do we can we try some other colours
      maybe.</p>

    <p>Try a more powerful colour this was not according to brief, nor this turned out different that i
      decscribed for I really like the colour but can you change it can you punch up the fun level on these icons. I
      know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost that will be a conversation piece or that's great, but can
      you make it work for ie 2 please you are lucky to even be doing this for us and just do what you think. I trust
      you, yet this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. Make it look
      like Apple can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this what is a hamburger menu nor we
      exceed the clients' expectations nor we don't need a backup, it never goes down! for we need more images of
      groups of people having non-specific types of fun.</p>
